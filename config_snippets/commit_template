# Type can be:
#   feat:     A new feature
#   fix:      A bug fix
#   docs:     Documentation only changes
#   style:    Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc)

#   perf:     Performance improvement
#   test:     Adding or correcting tests
#   chore:    Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
